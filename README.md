# rustchemist
A reimagining of Naturalchemist's core gameplay with a twist as a Rust practice.

Combine three of any elements to make it merge into the next one, but you must not leave any elements above the level. The twist, however, is that the four base elements (Air, Water, Earth, and Fire) do not react together!


Up - Rotate

Left/Right - Move

Down - Fall


W - Larger level

S - Smaller level
